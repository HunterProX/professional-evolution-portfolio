# Portfolio assistant

The floating **Portfolio assistant** (bottom-right button on every page) helps a
visitor find things in this site. It ships as **v1: honest keyword search**. It
is *not* a large-language-model chatbot, and it does not pretend to be one.

This document states what v1 actually does, what it deliberately does **not**
do, the plan for a v2 model-backed assistant, and the hard privacy rule that
governs both.

## v1 — keyword search (current)

### What it is

A dependency-free, client-side search over a small index that is **serialized
into the page at build time** from the canonical `data/*.json` files. There is
no backend, no API key, no network call, and no runtime data fetch. Opening the
panel and searching works offline once the page is loaded.

- **Component:** `web/src/components/AssistantWidget.astro`
- **Index builder:** `assistantIndex()` in `web/src/lib/data.ts` (reads only)
- **Matching logic:** `web/src/lib/assistant-search.ts` (zero imports, pure)
- **Copy (EN/ES):** the `assistant` block in `web/src/i18n/copy.ts`
- **Rendered on every page:** included by `web/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

### What it indexes

From the same canonical data the pages already render, nothing more and nothing
private:

| Kind | Fields in the index | Result links to |
|---|---|---|
| `work` (projects) | name, tags, slug, summary, status | `/work/<slug>/` in the current locale |
| `evidence` | label, url, claim status | `/evidence/` |
| `evolution` (milestones) | title, narrative, status, year | `/evolution/` |
| `profile` | name, headline, email | `mailto:` the published address |

### How it scores (no magic)

A query is lower-cased, de-accented, split on non-alphanumerics, and stripped of
a small English + Spanish stopword list. Each index entry has two buckets:

1. **strong tokens** — words from the entry's name/tags/title/label, plus two
   kinds of *keyword affordance* the build adds and documents:
   - the artifact-type words (`project`, `evidence`, `milestone`, `contact`, …),
     and
   - the site's own status vocabulary mapped to claim words (`live`→
     `demonstrated`; `lab`/`planned`→`aspirational`, etc.). These are the exact
     labels the pages already show, so a match never implies a claim the site
     does not already make.
2. **weak text** — the folded summary / narrative / headline / url.

A query token that equals a strong token scores **+3**; one found only as a
weak substring scores **+1**. A fixed, sub-one-point kind preference
(project > evidence > profile > milestone) only breaks ties, so the promise
"**name/tag/title matches beat summary/narrative matches**" is never inverted.
The top 3 are returned; **anything that scored only from the tie-break bias is
discarded**, so no token hit means no results.

### Honesty rules baked into the UI

- A **banner at the top of the panel** states in plain words, in both languages,
  that this is a keyword search over published data — *not an AI model* — that
  it can only point at what is already published, and that it says so when it
  finds nothing.
- On a **no-match**, the assistant renders a fallback (links to the full Work and
  Evidence listings plus an "Ask by email" `mailto:` prefilled with the exact
  question). It never invents an answer, never guesses intent, and never says
  "as an AI…".
- **No simulated intelligence anywhere:** no typing/dot animation, no "thinking"
  state, no canned prose, no model call. Results appear synchronously because
  the whole search is local.
- The input is **not** treated as private: nothing is stored or sent. The only
  outbound side is the deliberate `mailto:` the visitor chooses to open.

### Suggested questions

The panel offers four chips. Their **labels are localized** (EN/ES) but their
**queries are fixed English keyword sets**, because the canonical data is
English-only and a translated query would honestly return nothing. Clicking a
chip also reveals the query it ran in the input (transparency, not theatre).
Each is verified against the real index (`built`→projects, `ai`→the AI labs,
`contact`→the profile/email, the aspirational-vs-demonstrated chip→a labelled
mix). The verification harness for this is a throwaway script, not a shipped
dependency.

### Progressive enhancement & accessibility

- The floating button is hidden unless the pre-paint `html.js` gate ran; with
  JavaScript off the assistant simply is not offered, and every piece of content
  it would have indexed is already a normal published page.
- The panel is a real modal: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, labelled by
  its heading. It closes on **Esc** and **click-outside**; focus moves into the
  input on open, is contained while open, and **returns to the button** on
  close.
- Results change through an `aria-live="polite"` region.
- There is **no entrance animation at all**, so `prefers-reduced-motion` cannot
  be violated by motion that does not exist; hover transitions use the shared
  design tokens.
- The inline widget JavaScript (scoring included) is **~3.7 KB**, inside the
  <8 KB budget.

### Known limitations of v1

- It is **keyword** search: synonyms outside the indexed words will not match
  (there is no semantic/embedding layer).
- **Free-typed Spanish** queries match only where the English data happens to
  share a word or the folded token collides; use the chips for a guaranteed
  answer in Spanish. (Case-study bodies and project summaries are English by the
  site's own translation contract.)
- It can only answer **about published content**. It cannot reason, cannot
  combine facts across entries into new prose, and will fall back rather than
  improvise.

## v2 — provider-backed assistant (planned, blocked)

The mission requires an AI assistant **only if it is feasible**; it is not
feasible today because there is **no server function deployed and no model
credential available**, and the site is a static Astro build that must not
ship a secret. v1 is the useful, honest capability delivered under that
constraint.

When the blockers clear, v2 adds a **thin provider abstraction** without
changing the front end's contract:

1. **A Cloudflare Worker function** exposing `POST /api/assistant`. The static
   widget would call it only when a capability flag says a key is configured;
   otherwise it keeps behaving exactly like v1 (so the site never shows a dead
   or fake AI).
2. **Server-side secret.** The model API key lives in Worker **environment
   secrets**, never in the client bundle or the repo.
3. **Server-side prompt, built only from `data/*.json`.** The Worker assembles
   its context exclusively from the same canonical public data the site renders
   (projects, evidence, milestones, profile). The answer is grounded in, and
   limited to, published content — the assistant gains phrasing/synthesis, not
   new facts.
4. **Guardrails.** Per-IP rate limiting, a hard request timeout, and an explicit
   instruction to refuse anything outside the published data. Errors/timeouts
   return the same honest fallback the static path already shows, so a degraded
   v2 behaves like v1.

### Blockers (why v2 is not shipped)

- **Worker deploy authorization** for `POST /api/assistant` is not provisioned
  for this task.
- **A model API key** is not available and must not be committed into a static,
  public repository.

Both are infrastructure/credential gates, not code gates. This document records
them as the mission requires.

## Hard rule: never private Personal OS data

Under **both** v1 and v2, the assistant must only ever expose what this public
site already publishes. It must **never** read, index, retrieve, or paraphrase
private Personal OS data — the `inbox/private/` tree, employer/client detail,
credentials, un-published metrics, or any capability claim that is not backed by
a public artifact on `/work/`, `/evidence/` or `/evolution/`.

The v2 server prompt is constrained to `data/*.json` precisely so this rule is
structural: there is no path from the assistant to anything that is not already
a public, evidence-labelled page. See [Evidence boundary](evidence-boundary.md).
